# 📊 Data Science Portfolio

Welcome to my **Data Science Portfolio**! 🌟 This repository is where I share the data science and machine learning projects I am working on as I continue to learn and grow in this exciting field. While I am not an expert (yet!), these projects reflect my journey in applying data-driven techniques to solve real-world problems.

Each project covers different aspects of data science, from data exploration and preprocessing to building and evaluating predictive models. So far, you will find:

- 🏠 **Housing Price Prediction**. This project involves creating a regression model to predict house prices based on various features such as square meters, heating options, and garden availability.
  1. Dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mirbektoktogaraev/madrid-real-estate-market
  2. Models used: **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)** and **Decision Tree** regression models to make predictions.
  3. Input Features:
     * sq_mt_built
     * n_rooms
     * n_bathrooms
     * is_new_development
     * is_renewal_needed
     * has_central_heating
     * has_individual_heating
     * has_lift
     * has_private_parking
     * has_garden
  5. Target Feature: buy_price 
  6. Note: For simplicity, the model currently does not consider categorical parameters such as neighborhood or energy certificate. Future improvements should aim to incorporate these factors into the code.
- 🏢 **Apartment Condition Classification**: a classification model to predict whether an apartment is new or not, using various property features.

Feel free to explore the code and maybe even pick up a few ideas for your own projects! 🚀
