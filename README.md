# 📊 Data Science Portfolio

Welcome to my **Data Science Portfolio**! 🌟 This repository is where I share the data science and machine learning projects I am working on as I continue to learn and grow in this exciting field. While I am not an expert (yet!), these projects reflect my journey in applying data-driven techniques to solve real-world problems.

Each project covers different aspects of data science, from data exploration and preprocessing to building and evaluating predictive models. So far, you will find:

- 🏠 **Housing Price Prediction**: a regression model to predict house prices based on features such as square meters, heating, garden, and more.
  1. The script utilizes **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)** and **Decision Tree** regression models to make predictions.
  2. Input features: ; target feature: 
  3. For simplicity, the model currently does not consider categorical parameters such as 'neighborhood' or 'energy certificate'. Incorporating these factors should be considered for future improvements or updates to the code
- 🏢 **Apartment Condition Classification**: a classification model to predict whether an apartment is new or not, using various property features.

Feel free to explore the code and maybe even pick up a few ideas for your own projects! 🚀
