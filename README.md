# 📊 Data Science Portfolio

Welcome to my **Data Science Portfolio**! 🌟 This repository is where I share the data science and machine learning projects I am working on as I continue to learn and grow in this exciting field. While I am not an expert (yet!), these projects reflect my journey in applying data-driven techniques to solve real-world problems.

Each project covers different aspects of data science, from data exploration and preprocessing to building and evaluating predictive models. So far, you will find:

- 🏠 **Housing Price Prediction**: a regression model to predict house prices based on features such as square meters, heating, garden, and more.
  1. Dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mirbektoktogaraev/madrid-real-estate-market
  2. The script utilizes **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)** and **Decision Tree** regression models to make predictions.
  3. Input features: sq_mt_built, n_rooms, n_bathrooms, is_new_development, is_renewal_needed, has_central_heating, has_individual_heating, has_lift, has_private_parking, has_garden. Target feature: buy_price 
  4. For simplicity, the model currently does not consider categorical parameters such as 'neighborhood' or 'energy certificate'. Incorporating these factors should be considered for future improvements or updates to the code
- 🏢 **Apartment Condition Classification**: a classification model to predict whether an apartment is new or not, using various property features.

Feel free to explore the code and maybe even pick up a few ideas for your own projects! 🚀
